\begin{block}{Identification of Signaling Pathways}%
\paragraph{
    What is the structure of a cell signaling pathway, given a set of 
    concentration measurements? We answer this question
    with a computational model, created from \alert{a set of chemical 
    reactions}, that can reproduce the concentration dynamics observed 
    experimentally. These models are created using the laws of 
    biochemical kinetics, deriving a system of ordinary differential 
    equations.

    %\end{tabular}
    %\end{center}
    
        
}
\paragraph{
    As an example, we can model the following equation:
    \begin{equation*}
        \ce{A + B -> C} \implies \frac{d[C]}{dt} = k[A][B]
    \end{equation*}
    Where $k$ is a reaction rate constant.
}
\paragraph{
    However, to derive the model, we still need to determine what is
    the set of chemical reactions of the signaling pathway.

\begin{block}{Feature Selection}
\paragraph{
    We proposed to solve the identification of cell signaling pathways
    as a feature selection problem. This problem consists of: given 
    a set of features (reactions) and a score for each subset (the
    \alert{quality of a model}), what is the best subset?

}
\end{block}


\begin{block}{Bayesian Ranking of Models}
    To determine the \alert{quality of a model} we implemented a 
    score function that is a estimative of $p(D | M)$, which is the 
    likelihood of observing experiment $D$ under the assumption that 
    model $M$ is correct. To create this estimative we generate 
    samples of the posterior distribution of model 
    parameters ($\theta$).
    
    \begin{equation*}
        \underbrace{p (\theta | M, D)}_{\text{posterior}} \propto 
        \underbrace{p(D | M, \theta)}_{\text{likelihood}}
        \underbrace{p(\theta|M)}_{\text{prior}}
    \end{equation*}
    
    \leftfigparagraph{signetms_qr.png}{8}{4}{\hspace{1em}\\
        This ranking score was implemented as a Python package \\
        called SigNetMS. It is an open source software and \\
        it is available on GitHub.
