\begin{block}{Identification of Signaling Pathways}%
\paragraph{
    What is the structure of a cell signaling pathway, given a set of 
    concentration measurements? We answer this question
    with a computational model, created for \alert{a set of chemical
    reactions}, that can reproduce the concentration dynamics observed 
    experimentally. These models are created using the laws of mass 
    action, deriving a system of ordinary differential equations.
}
\paragraph{
    As an example, we can model the following equation:
    \begin{equation*}
        \ce{A + B -> C} \implies \frac{d[C]}{dt} = k[A][B]
    \end{equation*}
    Where $k$ is a reaction rate constant.
}
\paragraph{
    However, to derive the model, we still need to determine what is
    the set of chemical reactions of the signaling pathway.

%\begin{block}{Feature Selection}
%\paragraph{
    %We proposed to solve the identification of cell signaling pathways
    %as a feature selection problem. This problem consists of: given 
    %a set of features (reactions) and a score for each subset (the
    %\alert{quality of a model}), what is the best subset?

\begin{block}{Bayesian Ranking of Models}
    \paragraph{
    Given some experimental data $D$ and a model $M$ (composed by a
    \alert{a set o reactions}), we use an estimative of $p(D | M)$ as 
    a quality measure of model $M$. To create this estimative, we need
    to take samples from the posterior distribution of model parameters
    (reactions rate constants), denoted by $\theta | D, M$.
    %To determine the \alert{quality of a model} we implemented a 
    %score function that is an estimative of $p(D | M)$, which is the 
    %likelihood of observing experiment $D$ under the assumption that 
    %model $M$ is correct. To create this estimative we generate 
    %samples of the posterior distribution of model 
    %parameters ($\theta$).
    
    \begin{equation*}
        \underbrace{p (\theta | M, D)}_{\text{posterior}} \propto 
        \underbrace{p(D | M, \theta)}_{\text{likelihood}}
        \underbrace{p(\theta|M)}_{\text{prior}}
    \end{equation*}
}
    \leftfigparagraph{signetms_qr.png}{7}{4}{\hspace{1em}\\
        This ranking score was implemented as a Python package 
        called SigNetMS. It is an open source software and 
        it is available on GitHub.

\begin{block}{The Proposed Methodology}%
\paragraph{
    We proposed to solve the identification of cell signaling pathways
    as a feature selection problem. This problem consists of: given 
    a set of features (\alert{candidate reactions}) and a score for each
    subset (\alert{estimative of $p(D|M)$}), what is the best subset?
    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics[width=.94\textwidth]{featsel/featsel.pdf}
    \end{figure}
    The set of candidate reactions is stored in a database, which also
    stores information about model parameters, namely, the reactions 
    rate constants. The information in the database is extracted from 
    other public databases.

\begin{block}{Experiments}
\paragraph{
    We tested our ranking method on an experiment where create
    aritifical experimental data and try compare the found ranking for
    four models.

\end{tabular}
\end{figure}
    On this experiment we got the ranking: a $>$ b $>$ d $>$ c. This
    showed not only that we ranked the correct model first but also that 
    the complex models were penalized.

    \rightfigparagraph{experiments/surface_curve.png}{17}{5}{
    \hspace{1em} \\
    We also performed an expeirment in which we add reactions
    iteratively to a starting model. In this experiment we could 
    understand the surface of the score metric over our search space.

\begin{block}{Conclusion and Future Work}
    In this work we were able to create a score metric that is able to
    rank models in a Bayesian approach and embed this function to a 
    feature selection procedure. The next tasks we aim to accomplish
    are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item{Continue to study the surface of the search space;}
        \item{Apply the methodology in ERK signaling pathways of
            cell lines Y1 and HEK293.}
    \end{itemize}
