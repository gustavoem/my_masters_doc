Cell signaling pathways are important mechanisms that participate in 
many cell functions. It is possible to create computational models for 
these pathways with the analyses of biological assays in which the state 
of the cell is depicted with a series of concentration of chemical 
species. To construct such models, it is necessary to determine the set 
of chemical reactions that are relevant in the biological assay. 
Recently, a method was introduced to propose models systematically 
by adding reactions to a starting model. In this approach, with the 
definition of a score metric for models it was possible to solve the 
identification of signaling pathways as a feature selection problem, in
which the set of features is a set of possible chemical reactions 
extracted from KEGG. However, this method presented 
some shortcomings that impair the selected model; among them are the 
usage of naive search heuristics and the unsatisfactory penalization of 
overfitting models. We propose in this project to create a new
methodology that also tackles the identification of signaling pathways
as a feature selection problem. We propose to use a more general search
algorithm and a score metric that uses Bayesian inference to estimate 
the marginal likelihood of experimental data given a candidate model. 
We propose to test this methodology on the identification of pathways for
the Y1 adrenocortical tumor cell line. We already have produced a Python
program that calculates the chosen score metric and early results show 
that the chosen metric does penalize overly complex models.
