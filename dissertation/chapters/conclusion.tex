We will start this chapter with a review of the content presented in 
this dissertation, with some extra discussion of a few specific topics.
After that, we will present the main contributions of this work,
including technological tools and publications. Finally, we will close
this chapter with possibilities of future work related to this
dissertation.


\section{Review of Contents of this Dissertation}
% Review of the contents of this work
On the Introduction of this text, we presented the main aspects of cell
signaling pathways and how computational models can approximate their
dynamics. After that, we showed how Wu~\cite{Wu15} defined an approach
for model selection, of cell signaling pathwyas, as a feature selection
problem, and also the main caveats of their approach. With that, we
could state the goal of this project, which is to study and develop a
method for model selection using feature selection, where the cost 
function uses a Bayesian approach to calculate the cost (or score) of a
model.

% Why did we go for that goal?
% hability to input prior knowledge
% auto-penalize complex models

% Ok, then on chapter 2 we revised some content

% Then we reviewed state of the art model selection

% Then we produced an almost efficient way to calculate marginal
% likelihoods

% We then compared ABC-SysBio to SigNetMS

% And finally, we experimented on a small instance

% And what did we learn after all?
