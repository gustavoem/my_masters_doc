In this chapter we present the development process and implementation
details of the SigNetMS software, which stands for {\bf Sig}naling 
{\bf Net}work {\bf M}odel {\bf S}election. This software is capable of
producing an estimative of the marginal likelihood of a model given
experimental data, $p(M | {\bm D})$.

% What are we going to talk about in this chapter?
% - first, we have to talk about which methodology this software uses
%   -> make sure you citate BioBayes and how its cumbersome to use it
% to create a model ranking. we should state that we are using marginal
% likelihood estimates here.
%   -> make sure we specify the input and output of this software
%   -> include program arguments
% - then, we can talk about the implementation and optimizations
%   -> how did we implement the sampling? what was the used proposal
%   distribution?
%   -> fast integration of system of differential equations
%   -> parallel sampling
%   -> running the algorithm on a cluster
