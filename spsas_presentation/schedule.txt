We model the Signaling by
-> Cell Signaling Pathways, a cascade of chemical interactions with 
proteins.
-> We can the concentration change of the proteins with odinary 
differential equations
-> If we model all interactions of a pathway we get a system of EDOs, 
which actually has a lot of unkown parameters, related to rates of 
chemical reactions.

How do we chose the best model
-> Given some experimental data, we can model likelihood of a model and
its parameters.
-> Using something called Thermodynamic Integration we can marginalize
it and create a score.
