    %- we can see the problem as a feature selection problem;
    %- it didn't work out so well...
    %- she was only able to reconstruct models if the starting model was
      %already similar to the correct model
    %- this may have happened because: the database could be more nearly
      %complete; the search algorithm could be more general; her cost 
      %function could not penalize well overcomplex functions.
%- We propose then to create a new methodology that overcomes theses 
  %difficulties using a new cost function, defining a broader search

%- Objectives of this work.



\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}{Cell Signaling}
% Antes de mais nada, vamos entender o que são vias de sinalização 
% celular. 
% A sinalização celular faz parte da comunicação das células de um 
% organismo. Um sinal pode avançar 

%\begin{itemize}
%\item{
Cell signaling allows cells to respond to signals that come from its 
environment changing its behaviour accordingly.
%}
\pause
%\item{

This mechanism is essential for many cell functions, including 
reproduction, growth and death.
%}
\pause
%\item{

Understanding the functioning of cell signaling is important in many 
biological areas.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Cell Signaling Pathways}
A cell signaling network can be characterized by a sequence of chemical 
reactions that allows the presence of a signal to modify the state or 
behaviour of a cell.
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics{introduction/csp_example.pdf}
    \caption{An example of a signaling pathway.}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Mathematical Models of Signaling Networks}
In many applications, we summarize the state of the cell with a 
measurement based on the concentration of chemical species of the cell.
\pause

Using biochemical and enzymatic kinetics, we can write equations that
represent the rate of change of concentration for a chemical species.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Mathematical Models of Signaling Networks}
As an example, for the chemical reaction
\begin{equation*}
\ce{
    A -> B
},
\end{equation*}

\pause
we can write the following equation:
\begin{equation*}
        \frac{d[\text{A}]}{dt} = k_1[\text{A}]; 
\end{equation*}
where $k_1$ is a reaction rate constant.

\pause
Repeating this procedure for all reactions of a pathway allows us to 
derive a system of ordinary differential equations that can model the 
signaling pathway.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Identification of Cell Signaling Pathways}
The problem of identification of cell signaling pathways is the problem
of finding the components of a signaling pathway and how they interact
given a set of experimental measurement.

\pause
As the input, a description of a biological experiment and a set of 
experimental measurements are given. \pause A possible output to the 
problem is composed by:
\begin{itemize}
    \pause
    \item{a model composed by a set of chemical reactions that are 
        relevant for the biological experiment;}
    \pause
    \item{information about the reaction rate constants of the model.}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Identification of Cell Signaling Pathways}
One can search for the set of chemical reactions relevant for a 
biological experiment in repositories like the Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes (KEGG). \pause However, the pathway maps from KEGG may
be incomplete or have impertinent reactions for the biological 
experiment of interest.
\pause

Hence, it is desirable to construct a method that can systematically 
modify these models and choose the one that better represents the 
experiment.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Identification of Cell Signaling Pathways}
Lulu Wu (2015) presented in her master dissertation a methodology that 
proposes to systematically modify models of signaling network in order
to better represent experiments.
\pause

On her work, the problem of identification of cell signaling pathways is
treated as a feature selection problem.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Feature Selection Problem}
The feature selection problem is a combinatorial optimization problem:
\begin{center}
Given a set of features $S$ and a cost function $c$, find subset 
        $X \in \powerset (S)$, with minimum cost $c(X)$.
\end{center}

\pause
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[scale=.24]{introduction/Boolean_lattice.pdf}
    \caption{An example of feature selection search space with 5 
    features.}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Feature Selection for Identification of Signaling 
Pathways}
The methodology proposed by Wu defines the set of features as a set of 
chemical reactions that can be added to a starting model.\pause This set 
of chemical reactions is fetched from KEGG.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Wu's Search Algorithm for Feature Selection}
The search algorithm used by Wu is the Sequential Forward Selection 
(SFS).
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Wu's Cost Function for Feature Selection}
Wu defines the cost function as the minimum distance between 
experimental and simulated data. 
\pause
The minimum distance is found using a Simmulated Annealing 
that traverses the parameter space.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Wu's Cost Function for Feature Selection}
If we define that:\pause
\begin{itemize}
    \item{the experimental measurement is $D$;} \pause
    \item{the simulated measure is $\phi (M, \theta)$;} \pause
    \item{all elements visited on the Simmulated Annealing process 
        define $\Theta'$.}
\end{itemize}
\pause
Then, the cost function used on Wu's work is:
\begin{equation*}
    c (M) = min_{\{\theta \in \Theta' \subset \Theta\}}  
        dist (\phi(M, \theta), D) + R (M),
\end{equation*}
\pause
where $R (M)$ is a regularization function.
