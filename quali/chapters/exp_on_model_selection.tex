\section{Implementation of Marginal Likelihood Estimation with 
Thermodynamic Integration}
To perform the model ranking using an estimate of the marginal 
likelihood, we created the software SigNetMS, which is an acronym of 
{\bf Sig}naling {\bf Net}work {\bf M}odel {\bf S}election. This software
was implemented in Python and it is a free software, under the \emph{GNU 
General Public License}, and available on
\href{https://github.com/gustavoem/SigNetMS}{GitHub}.

The SigNetMS software can read and parse files containing models of 
signaling network represented in the Systems Biology Markup Language 
(SBML) format and then construct the respective system of differential 
equations according to the chemical species and interactions defined on
the file. The experiments observations and prior distributions of 
parameters are defined by the user with Extensible Markup Language (XML) 
files. Four other parameters are necessary to run SigNetMS, all of them
related to the sampling of the power posteriors. 

The sampling of the power posteriors is
